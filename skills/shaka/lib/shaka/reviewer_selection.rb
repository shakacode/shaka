  # What makes a review adversarial is the context, not the model: a fresh session that did not
  # produce the change reviews it honestly, even when it runs the model that wrote it. So there is
  # no disqualifying identity here and no blocker. A different provider is preferred because
  # different providers notice different things, and the implementation model in a fresh context is
  # an ordinary answer when no other is available. When a round runs several reviewers, the first
  # still prefers a different provider and the rest follow the maintainer's list order.
