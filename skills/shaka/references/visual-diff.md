# Make a difference image

Use an image tool that is already available. `command -v magick` shows whether
ImageMagick 7 is installed. A project's own screenshot tests may also produce
difference images; Playwright's `toHaveScreenshot`, for example, writes one when
an assertion fails.

When no tool is available, skip the difference image. Say so beside the captures,
for example “No difference image: no image comparison tool on this machine,” and
publish the clearest labeled before and after pair. Installing software on the
machine or adding a project dependency just for this evidence needs the user's
approval.

With ImageMagick 7, confirm the two captures have the same size, then write the
difference:

```sh
magick identify -format '%f %wx%h\n' before-desktop.png after-desktop.png
magick compare -metric AE -fuzz 2% before-desktop.png after-desktop.png diff-desktop.png
```

Compare the printed sizes yourself. `compare` still produces a result for images
of different sizes, and that result misleads the reviewer.

`compare` fades unchanged pixels and paints changed ones red. It prints the changed
pixel count and exits with status 1 when the images differ, so allow that exit in
scripts. `-fuzz 2%` ignores near-identical colors from antialiasing.

Attach the difference beside its source captures in one PR comment, as with any
capture. Put the label in the comment text or alt text; ImageMagick's `montage`
labels need a configured font and fail on some machines.
