# Settle comment-resolution work

The user's task includes resolving PR comments when they expressly ask for comment
resolution, either as the whole request or within broader work. The owner keeps that
task through the known review activity for the exact current head. A known review
source is required review, a user-requested review gate, or an optional reviewer
named by the trusted seam or its current-default-branch workflow. Its activity is
observed through a visible PR check or exact-head submitted review/report; verified
outage or quota evidence can establish that the named source has no runnable job.
Here, user-requested review is a gate only when the
user expressly makes completed review a readiness or merge condition; merely
naming or acknowledging a seam's optional reviewer retains optional semantics.
For each current head, begin one 10-minute optional-review wait budget at the
first refresh in step 1. This applies equally to an adopted PR and a newly pushed
head. During that budget, refresh for a named source's check or exact-head submitted
review/report to appear. Job transitions, retries, replacement, or disappearance
do not reset the budget. Before claiming that comments are resolved, follow all
four steps below. Before handing off a merge-ready PR, complete steps 1 and 2 and
the required/user-requested-gate clause in step 3; optional-review settlement stays
with the task owner and does not delay that handoff.

1. Record the exact PR head and refresh required checks and known review jobs.
2. Apply the [public-prose rule](review.md#read-public-review-prose-safely), then read the completed top-level reports and
   all inline threads, following pagination. Verify each completed review's visible
   report against that head. A report body withheld by the public-prose rule is not
   verified; retain its link and use the applicable optional handoff or required-gate
   maintainer path below.
3. Keep the PR unready while required review or a user-requested review gate is
   running or lacks
   a verified report; only the authority that set that requirement can change it.
   For each known optional review, handle posts while its job runs but keep waiting
   until GitHub records a terminal conclusion. A posted report does not settle a
   live job. A source that publishes reviews without a check is settled when its
   verified exact-head report is handled. Use the nonterminal handoff below rather
   than waiting forever for a queued or executing job. After observing the terminal
   result, spend up to 60 seconds refreshing
   the exact-head top-level reports and inline threads, then verify the final visible
   report and handle its findings. Apply the optional-review handoff below if no
   verified final report appears. This ownership delays task completion, not merge:
   existing merge authority may merge after its required gates pass, but the owner
   remains active and handles a later optional result under [Reviews after merge](review.md#reviews-after-merge).
4. If a fix changes the head, discard stale review and validation evidence. Re-run
   affected checks and repository validation, obtain or verify required review for
   the new head, reread native threads, and refresh the walkthrough. Return to step 1
   and repeat this procedure for the new head, starting a new wait budget, before
   completing the task.

This paragraph applies only to optional reviewers. An optional reviewer may remain
unavailable after any terminal job without a verified report—including success,
failure, skipped, cancelled, timed out, neutral, stale, or action required—or when
a verified provider outage or quota block leaves no runnable job. The active
optional-review wait also ends whenever its one 10-minute exact-head budget expires
without settlement, whether a job or report never appeared, a job remains
nonterminal, a job disappeared or was replaced, or a checkless report was withheld
or otherwise could not be verified. Transitions, timestamps, annotations, log output,
retries, and replacements never extend the absolute budget. The single post-terminal
60-second report refresh in step 3 is the only exception and may end after that
budget. An explicit handoff can then end the active wait; a verified report already
received still must be handled, while the nonterminal, missing, or unverified
residual state is handed to the named later owner.
Record in the PR summary and final response the reviewer and state, exact head,
feedback already handled, retained links for unread prose, terminal/outage/wait
evidence—including `no job or exact-head report observed during the wait budget`
when applicable—and who owns a later result.
This optional-review handoff does not change the general rule: required or
user-requested review gate still blocks readiness until it completes or the authority
that set it changes the requirement. Do not turn a pending result into a completed
one or create an automatic issue, monitor, or heartbeat.

Check names, status, conclusion, submitted-review state, and approval state are
metadata rather than review prose and remain readable under the public-prose rule.
They can establish native gates but cannot verify a withheld report body. When a
required or user-requested review gate depends on withheld prose, retain its link and
route it to a trusted maintainer for screening and handling; readiness remains blocked
until that happens or the authority that set the gate changes it.

For example, revision A can have green required validation while GitHub Claude is still running.
With `ci_review_wait: none`, if local review already covers A, merge A and treat the later
report as post-merge feedback. If independent review is not yet satisfied, keep the PR unready until it is.
Green validation at A never proves that a required backstop settled.
