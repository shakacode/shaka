# Delivery and communication

This is an operational reference used by the installed Shaka skill in any
repository. Read it when the workflow calls for planning, communication, PR
publication, or resuming unfinished work. Shaka contributor instructions live in
[contributor documentation](https://github.com/shakacode/shaka/blob/main/contributing/README.md).

Follow the installed Shaka workflow for execution order. Use this reference when
planning a task, splitting PRs, writing delivery updates, or recovering unfinished
work. For the product introduction, see [working with Shaka](https://github.com/shakacode/shaka/blob/main/docs/working-with-shaka.md).

## When the agent asks questions

Ask before an answer becomes expensive to change. Use existing context and earlier
answers, recommend a path, and continue independent work while a question is pending.
Silence is not approval.

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Task or checkout is missing | Ask for the description or repository path. |
| Another PR or owner covers the work | Report it and stop unless the user authorized comparison or takeover. |
| Repository policy is missing | Inspect scripts and CI; ask only for choices the evidence cannot establish. |
| Merge preference is unset | Ask early; default to Ask without an answer. Reuse authority already granted for this scope. |
| Model or effort needs selection | Follow the planning checkpoint below. |
| Routine, reversible implementation choice | Choose and continue; state assumptions that affect the result. |
| Product behavior, scope, or consequential risk is unclear | Explain the consequence, recommend a path, and wait before dependent work. |

For an import fix: “Some rows contain invalid dates. I recommend importing valid
rows and showing the rest for correction. Should an invalid row instead reject
the whole file?” This asks for a product decision while there is still time to
shape the implementation.

## Choose a small execution context

Assess scope and risk, recommend an available model and effort, and explain the
choice. Honor explicit user settings. Consider total planning, implementation,
retries, and review; waiting or a tool error alone does not justify more effort.

Use the workflow's `recommendation` and `checkpoint` commands. When the user says
`go` without naming model or effort, proceed with the current host settings.
Treat the recommendation as advisory; unknown or differing active settings do
not add a confirmation turn. If the host reports either setting, briefly note
its value and whether it matches the recommendation. Mark unreported values
UNKNOWN; a prompt cannot change the runner.

When the user names either setting, proceed only when immediate start is clear,
the recommended settings are active and usable, and the supplied settings match
the recommendation. Otherwise pause with one next action. Check host settings
on resume when available. Planning-only work returns its plan and usage without
an implementation checkpoint.

If the checkpoint reports `recommendation_missing`, supply the omitted model or
effort recommendation and rerun it. This is an agent input to complete before
bringing a decision to the user.

Work solo unless delegation is authorized and useful. Obtain a fresh-context
review before pushing meaningful implementation, using [reviewer selection](review.md#choose-a-local-reviewer).
A different provider is preferred; the implementation model in a fresh session
also qualifies. Missing local review capability is reported explicitly.

Use a new task for a new objective. Keep the existing task while it owns unfinished
work, or transfer ownership with its branch, revision, checks, remaining work, and
authority. Recheck live state on resume. Name tasks by repository, verified issue
or PR, and outcome; preserve user-chosen titles.

### Say what the work is worth

Before recommending settings, write one line naming the user problem and the
cheaper alternative considered: a guide sentence, setting, clearer error, or no
change. The helper renders the line; it does not judge its truth.

When the user named the task, its value is settled. When the agent proposed it or
found it in an unverified report, say so and wait for the user to accept the work.
That decision precedes any request to change model settings. Once accepted, reuse
the decision unless scope or expected cost materially changes.

### Recover an unfinished PR

Keep a collapsed **WIP Details** entry in the PR description until GitHub confirms
the outcome. Publish it through the `description` content's `wip` object. Snake_case
keys name the fields below; Chat name keeps the key `task` and Chat link keeps
the key `thread`. The helper
renders the fields as one table and refuses a hand-written `WIP Details`
details item. Refresh at
meaningful progress and every stopping point, with all other description fields
still accurate for the named head. An Ask handoff leaves the note in place with
state “waiting for GitHub merge” and the expected SHA. A failed merge also retains it.

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Owner | Public machine alias, host, and a random owner tag, such as `m5 · Codex desktop · k7q2` |
| Chat name | Current public-safe host chat title, copied exactly; otherwise `UNKNOWN` |
| Chat link | Raw host session URL, using the rules below; otherwise `UNKNOWN` |
| Last observed activity | Date, time to the minute, and timezone of the latest observed activity, such as `2026-09-25 17:42 PDT`; otherwise `UNKNOWN` |
| Revision | Branch and full current head as `BRANCH @ SHA`; `handoff` reads the SHA after the last ` @ ` |
| Workspace | Checkout directory, subject to the privacy setting below |
| Unfinished work | Uncommitted, untracked, deleted, stashed, or unpushed work; `none` only after inspection proves the branch holds everything |
| Stopped because | `running`, `awaiting merge approval`, `awaiting answer`, `paused`, or `interrupted` |
| Merge authority | Previously established `ask` or `auto`, or `UNKNOWN`; this field grants no authority |
| State | In progress, named check/review wait, blocker, decision, GitHub merge of a named head, or handoff to a named successor |
| Next action | One step that continues the task; while `awaiting-resume`, the prompt that resumes it, such as `$shaka PR_URL` |

**Chat title:** before each WIP publication, read the current title through the
host's session metadata when available. Review it for private content before
copying it into `wip.task`; use `UNKNOWN` for a title containing private details
and leave the actual chat title unchanged. Preserve user-chosen titles.
After a successful agent rename, read the title back and
refresh the owning unfinished PR's WIP Details before ending the turn. When a
manual rename is observed on resume or at the next publication, use that title.
Without a title-reading tool, use a title confirmed by the host in this turn or
`UNKNOWN`; a suggested `Chat name:` line alone does not establish the actual title.
The agent performs these refreshes; Ruby validates the supplied text and does
not compare it with host metadata or watch for renames.

For Stopped because, use `awaiting merge approval` for an Ask handoff that waits
for a GitHub merge click or approval; that stop also applies the
`awaiting-merge-approval` label. Use `awaiting answer` for a stop that waits for
a user answer. Publish a non-empty `decisions` list so the description applies
`awaiting-answer`. Use `paused` for any other
deliberate stop, such as a named check wait or a blocker.

Use safe filenames or counts for unfinished work; use `UNKNOWN` if the previous
checkout has not been inspected or cannot be reached. A fresh clone cannot prove
that another checkout has no unpushed work. An interrupted note may be stale;
its publication time does not prove subsequent activity. Keep private operational
details, tracker links, prompts, credentials, and customer information out of it.

**Session locators:** publish a raw URL, without Markdown or code formatting.
For Codex, require a UUID in `CODEX_THREAD_ID` and use `codex://threads/<thread-id>`.
For Claude Code, require `CLAUDE_CODE_HOST_SESSION_ID`, ask the host for that
session's metadata, and copy its `link` verbatim. The host session ID differs from
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, which identifies the usage transcript. Terminal sessions,
disabled app links, and other hosts use `UNKNOWN` until a supported locator exists.
A link's availability depends on the owner's machine being reachable.

**Privacy:** both team setup and private trials default `wip.include_locations` to
`true`. Supply the selected default-branch `--ref` to `description`.
The renderer replaces Workspace and Chat link with `REDACTED` when the setting is
false or unavailable, including before validation/review results exist. Retain the
fields and public owner alias. Inspect all other supplied prose before publication.
A repository where even the owner alias is sensitive should not publish these notes.
See [configuration](https://github.com/shakacode/shaka/blob/main/docs/settings.md#wipinclude_locations).

**Resume as the original owner:** read the live note before writing. If it names
another owner or tag, preserve local work without pushing, report the transfer,
and stop. Otherwise run `handoff OWNER/REPO NUMBER --root DIR --ref SHA` to read
the live head, label, checks, and walkthrough and WIP heads, then continue. A missing
or outdated note after a crash is a reason to inspect live state, not to abandon recovery.

**Take over in a new task:** require maintainer confirmation that the previous
owner stopped or is handing over. An idle task, old timestamp, or missing note
is insufficient. Then read the live head and publish a complete note with a new
owner tag before other work. Recheck checks, review, and merge authority. Inspect
and preserve staged, unstaged, untracked, stashed, and unpushed work when the old
checkout is reachable; record it as `UNKNOWN` when it is not.

The note records state. It is not a lock or authorization, and the read/write gap
still allows a race. Maintainer confirmation prevents competing owners.

## Reject an approach and restart

Use [human attention checkpoints](return-points.md) to identify earlier human guidance,
preserve the abandoned code and context, and resume with new steering. Requesting
attention alone records no human guidance. Keep the existing Ask/Auto decision path
and WIP note; summarize superseded attempts in the description's details while
carrying surviving material findings into the active review.

## Keep the task plan recoverable

Before implementing a proposed PR split or substantive design plan, save it in
the original work item's description or a clearly identified plan comment.
Keep one current plan there; summarize consequential discussion and decisions
from chat, and preserve earlier discussion when updating it. Routine choices
within a small task need no separate planning document.

Record the intended outcome, each PR's scope, order and dependencies, verification,
open decisions, and next action. Distinguish proposals from accepted direction.
Use existing user authorization for routine choices; ask before changing product
scope or making a risky partial release. A plan save adds no approval requirement.

Reuse permission already granted for this task and destination. An instruction
to keep the plan in the tracker authorizes subsequent plan and discussion updates
there within that scope. Reading the tracker or approving an approach alone does
not authorize writing it, creating more work items, or reorganizing the backlog.
When permission or access is missing, prepare the exact update and ask for the
missing permission or an accessible, authorized destination. Pause affected
implementation until the record is saved; continue independent work meanwhile.
For a task without a work item that needs a durable plan, agree on a project
document or tracker item before creating it. Keep private material in an
appropriate private destination.

For substantial architectural choices, recommend a linked design document or
architecture decision record (ADR) using the project's conventions. An ADR records
the decision, alternatives, and consequences; a design document can hold detailed
implementation analysis. Keep execution order, progress, and the document link in
the work item. Recommend either only when the detail warrants it; use the tracker
alone for a compact plan.

Before implementing a material correction, update the current plan with what
changed, why, and every affected PR, including one already awaiting review. Mark
superseded proposals and unresolved decisions clearly. Refresh affected PR
summaries so they point to the current scope, respecting tracker privacy.

At a PR handoff or merge, record its link and observed state, remaining outcomes,
dependencies, and next action in the plan. On resume, read that record and linked
documents, check live PR states and ownership, and select the next eligible
outcome. A pending prerequisite stays pending until live evidence shows it merged.
If the plan is missing or contradictory, reconstruct it from available evidence
and resolve consequential uncertainty before affected implementation.

## When a task needs several PRs

Default to one PR. Split for useful separate outcomes, different risks, or a diff
that is difficult to review. Around 500 changed lines is a reason to reconsider
scope, not a quota. Keep tests with the behavior they verify.

Recommend a short ordered list of outcomes, dependencies, and verification. Make
routine splits within the authorized task; ask about changed product scope or
risky partial releases. Each slice must be safe with its prerequisites.

Keep one task owner and use the [current task plan](#keep-the-task-plan-recoverable)
for dependencies and remaining scope. Link each PR to it when sharing is
authorized; keep private tracker content and links out of public PRs. A partial
merge does not finish the task. Report shared planning and review usage once with
its commit mappings.

Use ordinary PRs against the task's base. For dependent slices, merge the first
before publishing the dependent PR under the same Ask/Auto workflow.

If the work already exists on a large branch, extract an independently useful
prerequisite onto a branch from the validated base. Keep its tests with it and
review that PR on its own. After it merges, update the remaining branch and check
that the main PR no longer repeats the prerequisite changes. For example, extract
a required React upgrade before the React on Rails integration. Preserve the
original work while moving commits or hunks; never discard unrelated edits.

Native stacked PRs are not required or supported by this workflow.

## A short message, with evidence available

One owner communicates progress, decisions, and results. The final message names
the outcome, PR links, validation, and remaining action. Keep material risks,
required decisions, and missing evidence visible; link to supporting detail.

### Identify AI-authored posts

Begin GitHub descriptions, comments, and reviews with actual agent, provider,
model, and effort, for example:

> 🤖 Codex · OpenAI · gpt-6-astra · medium

Use `UNKNOWN` for unavailable values. This identifies the writer; reviewer and
contributor usage belongs in details. Preserve human text and label mixed work
AI-edited rather than claiming full authorship.

### Make the PR description useful first

Write for someone deciding whether to merge. State the outcome and why it
matters, then send them to the walkthrough and the code rather than retelling
the diff. Show blockers, decisions, and missing required review.
Include the check table, provenance, usage tables, and WIP Details note while unfinished.
Keep optional review history and routine rollback detail collapsed.

Supply the current COMMENT review URL in the `walkthrough` field. The helper
renders its link after the summary, or `_Not published yet._` until it exists.
Set the required `deployment` field to `auto`, an https URL, or `none`. `auto` reads
the GitHub Deployments API for the PR head and links the newest successful
deployment's `environment_url`, the same link GitHub shows as "View deployment";
it renders nothing when the head has none. Supply a URL yourself only when the
preview appears solely in a provider comment or CI log. The helper links it beside
the walkthrough.
Set the required `steps_besides_merging` field to `none` or a list of work the change
needs outside its merge, such as a secret to set before merge or a backfill to run after
it. The helper renders the list as a table under those links, where a maintainer sees it
before the checks, and refuses a description that leaves the field out.
Also link to the current review result. Self-edit the content JSON before
publication; let the helper render headings, tables, and details.

### Why the description and the walkthrough differ

The description explains the outcome and delivery decision. The walkthrough
explains why the implementation looks as it does. Each needs enough context to
stand alone, but copying sentences between them creates two versions to maintain.

Use these questions to place detail:

- Does it affect whether to merge or what to do afterward? Put it in the description.
- Does it explain a design choice or make the diff easier to understand? Put it in the walkthrough.
- Would a later reader need it from the merged PR alone? Keep it in the description.

A rollback may need an operational summary in the description and code-level
reasoning in the walkthrough. File paths alone do not decide placement.

### How a walkthrough is ordered

Open with the behavior that changed and why it was needed; the mechanism comes
after. A reviewer who stops early still gets the main point, and the reason for a
change is usually the hardest part to reconstruct from the diff.

Then explain changes in the order that makes them understandable: usually
contract or data model, core behavior, integrations, and finally tests,
documentation, and migration. Keep related parts together, explain each idea
before the step that needs it, and say where a reviewer should look hardest.

Explain unfamiliar terms on first use. Distinguish mechanical moves and generated
output from behavior changes. Cover purpose, choices, validation, risks, and
rollback consequences where they fit; avoid a heading for every checklist item.
Cover the change completely, then stop.

### Keep a walkthrough readable

- Link each step to the lines it explains with a commit-pinned permalink to a
  line range. One link per file leaves the reader searching. A change with no
  lines to link, such as a binary asset or submodule pointer, takes a
  commit-pinned file link instead.
- Describe the code at this head, compared with the base branch. Leave out the
  branch's own history: "was removed" or "now rejects" about an earlier commit
  on the branch goes stale and means nothing to a reader of the diff.
- Give each paragraph one idea and lead with it. Split a paragraph past about
  four sentences, and keep most sentences under 25 words.
- Use a list for parallel items, such as the guarantees a guard provides: one
  per bullet, each linked to its code. Keep reasoning in prose.
- Add one small diagram when control passes through three or more components,
  or when a state can move to more than one next state. Even then, skip it
  when one sentence can state the sequence. GitHub renders a `mermaid` code block in a
  review. Keep it to about ten nodes, label each edge with the action, and let
  the prose carry the explanation.
- Report validation as what it proves at this head: the behavior covered, the
  command, and its result. State each count once, and leave results from
  earlier heads to the description's review history.

For example, these three sentences state two guards, one of them twice:

> Slash-bearing relative shebang interpreters are rejected before the command
> runs. Guarded env shebangs reject environment assignments so a wrapper cannot
> replace the sanitized PATH. Direct relative shebang interpreters, including
> bare `#!node`, are rejected before launch.

A list states each guard once, with its code link:

> Before a selected wrapper runs, the interpreter guard rejects:
>
> - relative interpreters, including bare `#!node` (code link)
> - `env` shebangs that assign variables, which could replace the sanitized
>   PATH (code link)

Code checks little of this. The `walkthrough` command refuses a walkthrough
without a commit-pinned link to a changed file, or one that does not name each
completed required and review check. It does not check the rules above or
whole-diff coverage; they rest on the writer and on review, and
`shaka enforcement` lists them as agent-enforced.

### Keep one current walkthrough

Edit wording at the same revision in place. For a new commit, write a walkthrough
from the whole PR diff at that head (`git diff BASE...HEAD`), not only the new
commit, and update the description's link. Extending the previous
walkthrough carries its repair history into the new one. Keep review history in the
description's details rather than appending it to the walkthrough.

The walkthrough command collapses your older walkthroughs after it confirms the new
review. Each one leads with “Superseded — read the current walkthrough:” and that
review's link, and the old body and revision stay inside details. A details tag in
that archived prose is written as text so the disclosure stays closed; a fenced
example keeps its characters. Other authors'
reviews and independent reports stay as they are. When the edit is unavailable,
the new walkthrough still stands and the command reports the limitation. This
cleanup does not block merge.

Collapsed PR content is still public and still costs tokens when loaded. Store
useful evidence once; retrieve and link it as needed.

## Writing preferences

Before publishing, read [writing guidance](writing.md) and apply trusted repository
preferences.

## What the helpers protect

| Boundary | Responsible layer |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub argument handling, JSON parsing, and identifier checks | Ruby helpers |
| Expected commit, observable required checks, and supported merge state | Helpers and native GitHub enforcement |
| Which public comment bodies reach the agent | [Public-comment reader](public-comments-safety.md) |
| Task authority, execution safety, and adequate verification | Agent following trusted instructions |
| File, network, and credential access while running candidate code | Host permissions and execution environment |

The helpers do not prove the agent's judgments or create a sandbox. Review what
will be published and use restricted execution for untrusted contributions.
Private repositories can contain unsafe text and code too.

## Knowing whether communication improved

Use actual task and PR history to assess reading, repeated explanation, late
questions, and corrective work. Human active time needs a human estimate;
elapsed timestamps cannot establish it.

Check that the outcome is understandable without opening every detail, questions
arrived in time, and model/token evidence remains findable. Compare similar
accepted changes using the [pilot criteria](https://github.com/shakacode/shaka/blob/main/internal/requirements.md#success-evidence-and-commit-attribution).
A shorter document or a passing prose review does not establish better usability.
