## September 2026 trials

These observations were made on September 14, 15, and 17, 2026. A successful install or CLI
startup does not establish a complete workflow, and workflow success does not
establish complete usage attribution.

| Capability | Codex CLI 0.154.0 | Claude Code desktop 2.1.270, CLI 2.1.272 | Cursor CLI 2026.09.10-fd3934a | OpenCode 1.18.31 | Pi 0.85.1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Installation and startup | Dedicated skill installation and explicit trusted-file startup checked. | A symlinked personal skill loaded in the desktop app and in `claude -p`; `/shaka` asked for the task and merge preference and stopped before edits. A same-named repository skill did not replace it. | Dedicated CLI package version/help checked; Cursor skill instruction activation unverified. | Canonical `~/.config/opencode/skills` install documented; TUI activation trial pending. | Shared Agent Skill loaded from a trusted external source; no Pi-specific copy or launcher. |
| OS write boundary | A native workspace sandbox denied writes to the separate trusted source, installed link, and link directory while allowing the session and target checkout. | No launcher or sandbox; the user's permission mode applies. Not separately probed. | Native Cursor sandbox boundary unverified. | No launcher sandbox; the user's permission mode applies. The launcher disables project-local discovery so the target's `.opencode` plugins, config and instructions never load. Not separately probed. | The user's Pi tool permissions apply; no separate boundary was probed. |
| Real workflow | Protected PR operations exercised with Shaka. A fresh CLI task implemented and verified the Astro website guides using its repository instructions; the owning task handled publication. | One consumer PR delivered end to end on September 17, 2026: agent-workflows-com#62, branch through TDD, seam validation, five review rounds, helper-published description and walkthrough, helper merge in Ask mode. | Consumer delivery unverified. | Consumer delivery unverified. | The Pi usage-reader implementation was the first recorded delivery trial; broader consumer evidence remained pending. |
| Usage | Reader matched 14 real CLI responses and repeated-source input without double counting; attribution remains partial. | Reader matched an independent per-response aggregate for a desktop session with a subagent and two models, and Claude Code's own totals for two CLI runs. | Stop-hook reader works against captured desktop `3.20.21` `grok-4.6` payloads, but has not produced records in a real delivery ([#111](https://github.com/shakacode/shaka/pull/111)); transcripts and bubble `tokenCount` remain unused. | Export reader matched an independent per-response aggregate for a real 49-response session (all counters, interval, version); the session must be named with `--session` and attribution remains partial. | Reader matched an independent aggregate of selected active-branch responses, including reasoning and native nominal cost; abandoned branches were excluded. Compaction, branch-summary, and tool-nested model usage remain excluded. |

The Codex write test establishes that particular local boundary. It does not
establish equivalent behavior in the desktop app, other versions, or other hosts.
Repeated consumer use, including failed checks, changed PR heads, and Ask/Auto
stopping behavior, is still required before claiming broader adoption.
