# Frequently asked questions

## Can I customize the prompt Shaka gives its local reviewer?

Yes. In `.agents/agent-workflow.yml`, set
[`review.prompt_file`](settings.md#reviewprompt_file) to the path of a Markdown
file, relative to the repository root, such as `.agents/review-prompt.md`. It
replaces Shaka's default instructions for what the local reviewer looks for and
how it reports. To give one review agent different instructions, set
`prompt_file` on that agent's entry in `local_review_agents`. Copy Shaka's
[default instructions](../skills/shaka/config/review-prompt.md) to start.

The agent reads the file from the default branch when it runs
`shaka review run --criteria-ref`, so a PR that edits it is reviewed with the
current version. Criteria in `AGENTS.md` still apply on top of the prompt file.
The prompt file configures local reviews; a CI review job takes its prompt from
its own workflow.

A few rules stay whatever the file says, because they are protocol rather than
policy. For example, the closing `REVIEWED` line lets `shaka review run` confirm
which commit was reviewed. The [settings](settings.md#reviewprompt_file) list
them all.

## Can a PR change Shaka's settings or rules for itself?

Not until it merges. Settings and review criteria come from the default branch,
so each PR is reviewed under the rules its maintainers already agreed on, and a
PR from a fork cannot change how it is reviewed. Until it merges, Shaka reviews a
settings change as part of the diff. See [settings](settings.md).

## Where do I put project rules?

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Commands, merge policy, and review jobs | [Settings](settings.md) in `.agents/agent-workflow.yml` |
| Project constraints, review criteria, and writing style | `AGENTS.md` |
| What the local reviewer looks for and how it reports | [`review.prompt_file`](settings.md#reviewprompt_file), replacing Shaka's defaults |
| Changes to Shaka's workflow | A [fork of Shaka](workflow.md#customize-the-instructions) |

Keep `AGENTS.md` a regular file with the instructions in it; Shaka reads it from
Git at the trusted commit. Recent Claude Code versions can read `AGENTS.md`
directly, but not in every session, and not by default when a `CLAUDE.md` exists.
To give Claude the same instructions every time, add a `CLAUDE.md` containing
`@AGENTS.md` rather than a symlink. See Claude Code's
[AGENTS.md support](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#agents-md).

## Why did the agent stop to ask about model and effort?

Before it changes code, Shaka recommends a model and effort for the task and
waits for you. To skip the wait, name the model and effort it would recommend,
make sure they are active, and say “Go”. See [give it an outcome](working-with-shaka.md#give-it-an-outcome).

## Why didn't the agent merge my PR?

Under **Ask**, the default, the agent labels the PR `awaiting-merge-approval` and
names the commit to merge. Merge it on GitHub, or approve that commit and the
agent merges it. Under **Auto**, a PR
past the [size limits](settings.md#mergelimits), or one that changes trust,
authentication, releases, or other consequential areas, still comes back to you.
See [choose a merge policy](working-with-shaka.md#choose-a-merge-policy).

## Does a green review job mean the PR was reviewed?

No. A job can pass without producing a review. The agent reads the report and
counts only one that covers the current commit. See
[`review.ci_review_jobs`](settings.md#reviewci_review_jobs).

## Can the agent review its own work?

It prefers a reviewer from a different provider, in the order set by
[`review.local_review_agents`](settings.md#reviewlocal_review_agents). Next it
uses a listed reviewer from the same provider. When no listed reviewer is
available, a fresh session with the implementation model reviews the change
without the implementation conversation.

## Why did the agent ignore a PR comment?

Shaka trusts the people who maintain the project: anyone with write access, plus
the users, bots, and teams listed in `.agents/trusted-github-actors.yml` or your
machine's allowlist. On a public repository, anyone else can comment, and that
text could try to steer the agent. The agent withholds those comments and keeps
their links for you to read. See
[configure trusted actors](../skills/shaka/references/public-comments-safety.md#configure-trusted-actors).

## What does Shaka enforce, and what relies on the agent?

Ruby checks settings and trusted comment authors. When the agent merges, it also
checks the reviewed commit and that a local review of that commit was posted, or
that a reason for skipping it was given. How thorough that review was, test
quality, screenshots, and privacy rely on the agent's judgment. See
[what is enforced](workflow.md#what-is-enforced).
