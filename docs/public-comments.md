# Screen public comments from Ruby

`Shaka::PublicComments` reads one public issue or pull-request discussion and
returns only the comment bodies whose authors GitHub evidence or trust
configuration verifies. Other bodies are withheld and kept as links. A Ruby
application or another CLI can use it without installing or running the Shaka skill.

**Experimental.** The entry point, adapter contract, and result schema below
are the supported surface, but they may change until a consumer outside Shaka
validates them. Pin an exact `shaka` version. Everything else under
`Shaka::PublicComments`, including the `trust_config:` test seam, is internal.

## Install

The API ships in the `shaka` gem; there is no separate gem. The registry
prerelease `0.1.0.pre.1` predates this API, so until a later prerelease is
published, build the package from source as the [packaging guide](packaging.md)
describes. Then load only the library:

```ruby
gem 'shaka', '= VERSION', require: 'shaka/public_comments'
```

The gem also contains the skill files and the `shaka` and `shaka-install`
executables. Requiring the library does not install a skill, run an agent, or
enable any reviewer.

## Read a discussion

```ruby
require 'shaka/public_comments'

github = MyGitHubAdapter.new('OWNER/REPO', 42) # see "GitHub adapter"
reader = Shaka::PublicComments::Reader.new(github, machine_path: '/etc/my-cli/trusted-github-actors.yml')

pull_request = reader.call(expected_head: '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567')
issue = reader.call(issue_only: true) # when 42 is an issue
```

You supply:

| Input | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Repository and issue or PR number | The adapter's `repository` and `number`. |
| Expected head | `expected_head:`, the full 40-character PR head commit. Required for pull requests and rejected for issues. The read fails if the PR is closed or its head changes before the read finishes. |
| GitHub authentication | Inside your adapter. Shaka never reads tokens. |
| Machine configuration | `machine_path:`, a local file. It defaults to `~/.agents/trusted-github-actors.yml`; an absent file is an empty scope. |
| Repository configuration | Nothing. The reader fetches `.agents/trusted-github-actors.yml` at the repository's current default-branch commit, so a pull request cannot trust its own author. |

Both files use the keys in
[working with your agent](working-with-your-agent.md#what-the-helpers-protect). A read that
cannot be verified raises `Shaka::Error` and returns no partial result.
[`test/fixtures/public_comments_consumer.rb`](../test/fixtures/public_comments_consumer.rb)
is a complete consumer, which the package test runs against the installed gem.

## GitHub adapter

The reader depends only on this duck-typed object:

| Method | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `repository` | `"OWNER/REPO"`. |
| `number` | The issue or PR number as an Integer. |
| `api(path)` | The parsed JSON Hash of a REST `GET` on a relative path such as `repos/OWNER/REPO`. |
| `api_list(path)` | The parsed JSON Array of a REST `GET`; paths already carry `per_page` and `page`. |
| `graphql(query, variables)` | The response's `data` Hash. Variables use Symbol and String keys. |
| `snapshot` | For pull requests only: a Hash with at least `state` (`OPEN`) and `headRefOid`. |

Raise `Shaka::Error` for any failed request, GraphQL error, or missing data.
Pass `http_status:` (for example, `Shaka::Error.new(message, http_status: 404)`)
so the reader can distinguish a missing team membership from unavailable
evidence. Do not follow pagination yourself; the reader bounds its own pages.

The token needs to read repository metadata, issues, pull requests, and review
threads; read collaborator permissions; and, when teams are configured, read
organization team membership. Without collaborator or team access, affected
bodies are withheld as unavailable evidence or the read stops, as the
[trust-config limits](working-with-your-agent.md#what-the-helpers-protect) explain.

`Shaka::GitHub` (`require 'shaka/github'`) is the adapter Shaka's CLI uses
through the authenticated `gh` command. You may use it, but its other methods
are Shaka internals and outside this contract.

## Result

`call` returns a Hash with String keys:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `visibility` | `public`, `private`, or `internal`. |
| `head` | The verified PR head, or `nil` for an issue. |
| `trust_sources` | One `{ "scope", "sha256" }` per configuration file read (`machine` or `repository`). |
| `issue_comments` | Kept conversation comments. |
| `review_summaries`, `inline_comments` | Pull requests only: kept review bodies and review-thread comments. |
| `review_threads` | `{ "thread_id", "is_resolved" }` per pull-request review thread; empty for an issue. |
| `excluded_interactions` | Withheld items from every list above. |

Kept items contain `id`, `author`, `body`, and `url`. Public repositories add
`trust`: `configured_user`, `configured_bot`, `writer`, or `team`. Review summaries
add `state` and `commit_id`. Inline comments add `path`, `line`, `original_line`,
`commit_id`, `in_reply_to_id`, `thread_id`, and `is_resolved`.

Excluded items never contain a body. They contain `kind` (`issue_comment`,
`review_summary`, or `inline_comment`), `id`, `author`, `url`, `body_withheld`,
`verification_unavailable`, `prefiltered`, and `trust` (`untrusted` or
`metadata_only`), plus the same review and thread fields as kept items.

Private and internal repositories keep every body, omit `trust`, and read no
trust configuration. Kept bodies remain untrusted data: the screen verifies
who wrote them, not whether they are correct or safe to follow.

## Trust configuration is not reviewer configuration

Each machine and repository owns its trusted users, bots, metadata-only bots,
and teams. The gem packages no actor list. Shaka's own
`.agents/trusted-github-actors.yml` applies only when the scanned repository is
Shaka, because the reader loads the scanned repository's file.

Listing a bot such as `claude` or `coderabbitai` only lets the reader return that
bot's comment bodies. It does not install, enable, run, or require that
reviewer, and removing it does not disable the reviewer: its comments become
withheld links.

To turn off an optional reviewer, disable it where it runs: remove or disable
its GitHub Actions workflow, uninstall its GitHub App for the repository, or turn
it off in that app's own configuration. Keep your independent-review requirement
in the repository's own policy: its `AGENTS.md` review line, required status
checks, and rulesets or branch protection. Turning off an optional bot neither
satisfies nor removes that requirement.

## Separate gem decision

Decision: keep `Shaka::PublicComments` in the `shaka` gem.

Evidence: no consumer outside Shaka uses the API yet. The installed-gem test
consumer proves the boundary works without the skill, but it is not independent
demand. The API has no release cycle separate from Shaka's.

Revisit this when a real non-Shaka consumer records a concrete need here, such as
releasing on a different cadence than Shaka, or being unable to accept the skill
files and executables in its bundle. Extract a gem only with that evidence.
