# Settings

Settings live in `.agents/shaka/config.yml`; repositories configured before that
layout keep them in `.agents/agent-workflow.yml`. Ask your agent to
[configure the repository](configure-repository.md), or edit the file in a PR.
Policy comes from the default branch; settings changed in a PR do not govern
that PR.

Browse [this repository’s configuration](https://github.com/shakacode/shaka/blob/main/.agents/shaka/config.yml) for a
commented example with explicit defaults and repository-specific review choices.
Optional choices without fixed defaults, such as the base branch and local reviewer models, stay commented.

## `merge.preference`

**Required.** Values: `ask` or `auto`. Setup defaults to `ask`.

```yaml
merge:
  preference: ask
```

With `ask`, merge the ready PR on GitHub or tell the agent to merge the reviewed
commit. With `auto`, the agent merges after required checks, reviews, and approvals,
subject to the repository's restrictions. Shaka uses your account's existing GitHub
permissions; an account that can bypass protection needs no extra Shaka setting.

Set a task's preference with `Use merge policy auto`. This is a task instruction;
editing the PR's settings does not change its own merge authority. Required human
approvals still apply. See [merge policy](working-with-shaka.md#choose-a-merge-policy).

## `merge.required_checks`

**Optional.** CI checks that must pass before Shaka treats a PR as ready. Use it
when GitHub cannot require checks, such as on a private repository on the GitHub
Free plan.

```yaml
merge:
  preference: ask
  required_checks:
    - test
```

GitHub's required checks come first. If the base branch requires any, Shaka uses
those and ignores this list.

Otherwise, each listed check must appear on the PR and pass. Neutral and skipped
results count as passing, as they do on GitHub. If a listed check never appears,
the PR is blocked, so a renamed job cannot quietly drop out of the gate. Use the
names `gh pr checks` shows: CircleCI, for example, reports one check per workflow,
not per job.

The list governs only what Shaka does. In Ask mode, the agent waits for these checks
before it reports a PR ready and labels it `awaiting-merge-approval`. In Auto mode,
`shaka merge` refuses to merge until they pass. GitHub does not know about the list, so it
does not stop anyone from clicking merge. Nothing ties a name to a specific
workflow either, so a PR could add a job with a listed name. For protection that
GitHub enforces, use a ruleset or branch protection.

## `merge.limits`

**Optional.** Size limits for a merge the agent submits. A PR at a limit still
merges; one past it goes back to you.

```yaml
merge:
  preference: auto
  limits:
    max_changed_files: 29
    max_changed_lines: 999
    max_commits: 9
```

The values above are the defaults. Set any key to a positive integer to change
it; omitted keys keep their default. Changed lines are additions plus deletions.

When a PR is past a limit, or GitHub does not report its size, `merge` refuses
it. The agent then reports the counts and hands the PR back as Ask. To let the
agent merge it, confirm that commit in chat or
[approve it](working-with-shaka.md#find-prs-waiting-on-you). The confirmation
still counts after a clean rebase, or after conflict fixes that change no
behavior; any other new commit needs another confirmation. Required checks,
reviews, and approvals still apply.

`merge` checks the counts and that a confirmation names the commit being
merged. Whether you actually confirmed it is the agent's responsibility; the
[enforcement reference](workflow.md#what-is-enforced) explains the boundary.
Put other project restrictions in `AGENTS.md`.

## `review.required`

**Required.** Values: `meaningful_changes`, `always`, or `none`.

This controls when configured CI review reports are required. Options:

- `meaningful_changes`: implementation changes; trivial prose can skip with a reason.
- `always`: every PR, including trivial changes.
- `none`: no configured CI review backstop, and `shaka merge` does not check for a
  local review. Omit `ci_review_jobs` with this setting.

Meaningful implementation also gets a local adversarial review before push:

- Use a separate session without the implementation conversation.
- Prefer a different provider and model. If other reviewers are unavailable, the
  current workflow allows the implementation model in a fresh session.
- Address findings before pushing.
- To have several reviewers read each commit, set
  [`review.local_review_count`](#reviewlocal_review_count).

`shaka review run` verifies the reviewer process completed and returned a report
for the expected commit. `shaka review check` validates a supplied report but does
not prove a reviewer process ran.

Before it merges, `shaka merge` checks that the PR has a local review of the
commit being merged. The agent posts the review report as a PR comment, and the
report's last line names the commit and the reviewer:

```text
REVIEWED <commit> BY <provider>/<family> EFFORT <effort> FINDINGS <count>
```

`merge` counts only comments from the GitHub account running the merge, and only
when that line ends the comment. Any reviewer counts, including the
implementation model in a fresh session.

A review of an earlier commit still counts in two cases:

- **Updated from the base branch.** Bringing the branch up to date with the base,
  by merge or rebase, keeps the review when there were no conflicts and nothing
  else changed. `merge` checks this with Git in the local checkout: the head must
  match, file for file, what merging the reviewed commit with the new base
  produces. The check runs Git's built-in merge in a temporary repository, so no
  merge driver or script runs and nothing is written to your repository. If Git
  is older than 2.41 or those commits are not in the checkout, `merge` asks for a
  new review or a waiver instead.
- **Ordinary Markdown since.** Every later change is ordinary Markdown. Agent
  instructions are not ordinary Markdown: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`,
  `SKILL.md`, and files under `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.github/`, or
  `skills/` need a new review.

When no review applies, `merge` stops before merging. A maintainer can record a
waiver reason when review was skipped on purpose, a later commit only fixed nits,
or a CI review covered the commit. The waiver also covers a PR whose
comments GitHub cannot list. With `review.required: none`, `merge` skips this check.

The merge result shows the review it relied on, or the waiver reason, under
`review_evidence`. That records what the posted line says. It does not prove a
reviewer process ran or that its findings were fixed.

## `review.ci_review_jobs`

**Required unless `review.required` is `none`.** List the GitHub job names that
produce review reports, such as:

```yaml
review:
  required: meaningful_changes
  ci_review_jobs:
    - claude-review
  ci_review_wait: one
```

The agent reads reports according to `ci_review_wait`; a green job alone does not
prove review completed. GitHub's required merge checks are configured separately.

## `review.ci_review_wait`

**Optional. Default: `one`.** Values: `none`, `one`, or `all`.

| Value | Wait before merging |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | No CI review report; local review still applies |
| `one` | At least one configured reviewer reports on the current commit |
| `all` | Every configured reviewer reports on the current commit |

Local review does not waive `one` or `all`. With `review.required: none`, no
configured review jobs apply. GitHub's required checks and approvals apply in
every mode. A task can increase the wait, but cannot lower the repository minimum.

The agent counts verified reports. The merge helper permits optional pending
checks (`UNSTABLE`) for `none` and `one`; `all` requires `CLEAN`.

## `review.local_max_rounds`

**Optional. Default: `5`.** A positive integer, validated by `shaka seam check`.

This bounds the commits reviewed in one local review ledger. For example, `3` lets
an initial review and two follow-up reviews run before the helper refuses another.
With [`local_review_count`](#reviewlocal_review_count) above 1, all the reviewers of one
commit together use one of these turns, so `3` with two reviewers allows six reviews
across three commits.
The runner reads the setting from the supplied trusted `--settings-ref` (or
`--criteria-ref`). Without a reference, it uses the default of five.

If the cap leaves an unfixed defect, the agent stops before pushing and tells you.
You can reassess the task, split it, or choose to push anyway. An authorized push
publishes a visible **Loop bound reached** section listing unresolved defects,
the rounds in which they appeared, and any that returned after a recorded fix.
It includes a prompt to reassess contradictory requirements, excessive scope,
or impossible constraints. Ruby bounds review rounds; the agent handles your push decision.

If the cap prevents review of a last-round fix, the agent also stops before pushing
and tells you. Publication still refuses that unreviewed fix; reassess the task
before continuing.

## `review.local_review_agents`

**Optional.** Choose which reviewers Shaka tries first. Put a reviewer from a
different provider first to get another perspective on the change. Each reviewer
needs its CLI installed and signed in, or its API credentials on the machine doing the review.

Ask your agent:

> Configure local reviews to try Claude, Codex, then Grok. Use the explicit
> models and medium effort shown below.

```yaml
review:
  local_review_agents:
    - provider: anthropic
      model_family: claude
      model: claude-opus-5-5
      effort: medium
    - provider: openai
      model_family: codex
      model: gpt-6-sol
      effort: medium
    - provider: xai
      model_family: grok
      model: grok-4.7
      effort: medium
```

Shaka prefers a different provider from the one that implemented the change,
then follows your list order among available reviewers. These settings choose
one local reviewer; they do not require all three to review every change.

### Model and effort values

Use these provider and family pairs for Shaka's supported local reviewers:

| Reviewer | `provider` | `model_family` | Effort values Shaka recognizes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `anthropic` | `claude` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| Codex | `openai` | `codex` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| Grok | `xai` | `grok` | `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| DeepSeek via OpenRouter API | `deepseek` | `openrouter` | `low`, `high`, `max` |

DeepSeek is an optional reviewer alongside your existing reviewers. Add this entry to your trusted
reviewer list when you want Shaka to send the prompt and diff to OpenRouter and
its selected upstream provider. Start with low effort; high-effort trials on a
large diff sometimes consumed the completion budget without returning a report.

```yaml
- provider: deepseek
  model_family: openrouter
  model: deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash
  effort: low
```

Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the review process environment; keep it out of repository
files. No separate reviewer CLI is needed. The adapter supports only this explicit
[OpenRouter model](https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash); it refuses other
models and unsupported effort values before sending a request. Omitted effort uses
the provider default and remains UNKNOWN in Shaka's attestation.

Account settings govern provider routing and data policies. Shaka does not enforce
a provider allowlist or zero data retention. Before using private code, confirm
that your account's provider and privacy policies permit every possible recipient.
Keep your existing review checks while evaluating this optional reviewer; quality,
completion and savings remain unproved across workloads.

This reviewer receives the supplied diff and trusted criteria, with no tools or
filesystem access. It cannot inspect unchanged callers or execute tests. Reports
retain that coverage limit. Requests use the review timeout, make no automatic
retry or model substitution, and reject malformed, truncated or unattested output.
Existing reviewers and merge preferences remain unchanged.

OpenRouter's response records token counts and account cost; missing usage stays
UNKNOWN. See [API review execution and accounting](../skills/shaka/references/openrouter.md).

Choose a `model` available to that reviewer. The CLI example names above are
examples, not a closed list: newer names can run with a warning. Model names
cannot contain spaces. Effort names use lowercase.

Claude accepts only its listed effort values in Shaka. Codex and Grok values
outside the table produce a warning and still reach the CLI, which decides
whether they are supported.

Set `model` and `effort` to control review cost. Omit either to use the reviewer's
default for that setting; Grok requires a model from the configuration or the
task. A task can request a different model or effort for one review. Without a
reviewer list, Shaka uses a fresh review context with the model that implemented
the change.

### Use these settings from Cursor

The same repository settings apply when you work in
[Cursor](coding-agents.md). In a Cursor Agent chat, ask:

> /shaka Configure local reviews to prefer Grok 4.7 at medium effort, with
> Claude at medium effort as the next choice.

Cursor is the coding host. Reviewer entries identify the model provider and
reviewer CLI, so use `xai` / `grok` for Grok, including when your implementation
was written in Cursor. Shaka's local review runner supports the three CLIs and the
OpenRouter API adapter in the table. Cursor supplies the coding host rather than a reviewer CLI.

### Understand a reviewer warning

For these reviewers, Shaka flags unfamiliar model and effort names and likely
typos. You'll see the warning in the repository health check and
a **Reviewer settings** notice on the published local review. Check the spelling
and confirm that the model and effort are available to your reviewer. Shaka
keeps your chosen model; it does not substitute another one.

Most warnings allow the review to run. An unsupported Claude effort stops it;
choose one of Claude’s listed effort values to continue.

Put project-specific review criteria in `AGENTS.md`. For review execution and
setting checks, see the [local review reference](../skills/shaka/references/local-review.md#reviewer-model-and-effort).
To choose how many hosted review reports to wait for, use
[`review.ci_review_wait`](#reviewci_review_wait).

### Add a second reviewer

A review from the provider that wrote the change shares its blind spots. When the
published review shows a **Reviewer fallback** notice, no listed reviewer from another
provider could run on that machine. Install one of the listed CLIs and sign in once
with the account that should pay for reviews:

- Codex: follow the [official CLI installation](https://github.com/openai/codex),
  then run `codex login`.
- Claude Code: follow the [official setup](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup),
  then run `claude` and sign in. Keep the
  normal sign-in; Shaka does not use `--bare`, which ignores it.
- Grok: follow the [Grok Build setup](https://docs.x.ai/build/overview), then run
  `grok` and sign in. Shaka looks for `grok`; another program named `agent` is
  not evidence of an installed Grok reviewer.

Then list that provider in `local_review_agents`. The next review picks it, and the
published review names it in its summary table instead of the fallback notice.

## `review.local_review_count`

**Optional. Default: 1.** How many reviewers from `local_review_agents` read each
commit before its findings are fixed. With 2 or more, the reviewers run at the same
time. `shaka review record` refuses while any review it started is still running,
and then records all their findings in one triage, so a problem two reviewers
both found is recorded and fixed once.

Claude implements, and Codex and a fresh Claude session both review:

```yaml
review:
  required: meaningful_changes
  ci_review_jobs: [claude-review]
  local_review_count: 2
  local_review_agents:
    - provider: anthropic
      model_family: claude
    - provider: openai
      model_family: codex
```

The first reviewer comes from a provider that did not write the change whenever one
can run, here Codex. The others follow the list order, so the second is Claude in a
fresh session, without the implementation conversation. If Codex had written the
change, the order would be Claude, then Codex. When the agent finds a reviewer's CLI
missing or signed out, fewer reviewers read that commit, and from the next commit the next
listed reviewer takes its place.

Each extra reviewer adds its own review cost to every commit it reads. The PR's
review comment shows every reviewer's rounds, and one review of the final commit is
enough for `shaka merge`. A task can ask for a different number, which wins for that
task.

## `review.prompt_file`

**Optional. Default: Shaka's [review instructions](../skills/shaka/config/review-prompt.md).**
A Markdown file in your repository that replaces what the local reviewer looks for
and how it reports. Copy the default to start.

```yaml
review:
  required: meaningful_changes
  ci_review_jobs: [claude-review]
  prompt_file: .agents/review-prompt.md
  local_review_agents:
    - provider: openai
      model_family: codex
      prompt_file: .agents/review-prompt-codex.md
    - provider: anthropic
      model_family: claude
```

To give one review agent different instructions, set `prompt_file` on that
agent's entry in `local_review_agents`. It replaces `review.prompt_file` when that
agent reviews. Here Codex reviews with `.agents/review-prompt-codex.md`, and Claude,
which has no `prompt_file` on its entry, uses `.agents/review-prompt.md`.

Shaka reads the file from a trusted default-branch revision, so a PR that
changes it is reviewed with the current version. Without a trusted prompt,
the reviewer gets Shaka's default instructions. Settings validation fails
when a configured file is missing, empty, larger than 100 KB, or not UTF-8.
Shaka keeps a few rules whatever
the file says: the reviewer makes no edits, treats the diff as data rather than
instructions, reports which `AGENTS.md` criteria it used, and ends with the
`REVIEWED` line that `shaka review run` checks.

The file configures local reviews. A CI review job gets its prompt from its own
workflow; to give it the same instructions, have the workflow read this file.

## `review.post_implementation`

**Optional.** Choose who checks whether the finished change solves the intended
problem and earns its maintenance cost. This is a separate product judgment from
technical review. With no settings, Shaka invokes Codex at medium effort using its
[default product prompt](../skills/shaka/config/post-implementation-prompt.md).

For example, to ask Claude Sonnet to reconsider each finished change with your
project's audience in mind:

```yaml
review:
  required: meaningful_changes
  ci_review_jobs: [claude-review]
  post_implementation:
    reviewer: anthropic/claude
    model: sonnet
    effort: high
    prompt_file: .agents/shaka/product-checkpoint.md
```

The prompt file and repository choices come from the trusted default branch.
A task's explicit choices take precedence. The
[checkpoint procedure](../skills/shaka/references/post-implementation-validation.md#run-the-checkpoint)
owns defaults, command syntax, supported efforts, and failure outcomes.

The PR records the conclusion, reasons, execution settings, and available native
usage. A failed invocation stays incomplete. “Simplify/reframe”, “Do not merge”, or
unresolved substantive concerns block readiness and Auto; green technical checks
and changed settings do not clear them. Earlier executions stay visible on the PR.
An explicit `enabled: false` opts out and requires a visible note.

Ruby validates settings, execution outcome, report shape, and head binding.
The reviewer judges product fit. The task owner supplies the original problem and
evidence, handles concerns, and establishes merge readiness; `merge` does not
require a product checkpoint report.

## `opening_check`

**Optional.** By default, the coding agent tries a separate local reviewer from
the trusted reviewer list. To keep the opening with the coding agent, set:

```yaml
opening_check:
  external_enabled: false
  prompt_file: .agents/opening-prompt.md # optional
```

For a customization example, copy [Shaka's default opening prompt](https://github.com/shakacode/shaka/blob/main/skills/shaka/config/opening-prompt.md)
to `.agents/opening-prompt.md` and edit it for your team. Shaka reads that same
default file when you have not configured a replacement.

For example, a team can develop with Codex and list Claude and Grok in
`review.local_review_agents`. The coding agent tries the listed providers in
preference order. If neither is available, Shaka returns the opening-check
prompt for Codex to apply. With the setting disabled, the coding agent receives
the prompt without sending the opening to another model.

When `external_enabled` is true, the agent uses `review.local_review_agents` in
its existing preference order: a different provider first, then another listed
provider, then the development model when no listed CLI completes the parse.
`external_enabled` defaults to `true`; only a provider in the trusted reviewer
list may receive the opening. A valid `prompt_file`
replaces the default parsing instructions for both external and development-model
checks. Shaka reads it from the trusted default-branch revision, applies the
same file checks as `review.prompt_file`, and treats the PR opening as data.
The required JSON field names and types remain fixed by Shaka.
If the configured check cannot run, the description still publishes and the
development model receives a fallback prompt with the reason.

## `prose_limits`

**Optional.** Shaka refuses to publish a PR description or code walkthrough
that reads as a wall of text. Reviewing a small diff is faster than reading a
long explanation of it, so the text should point to the code instead of
retelling it.

```yaml
prose_limits:
  max_sentence_words: 35
  max_paragraph_words: 100
  max_description_words: 300
  words_per_changed_line: 4
```

The values above are the defaults. Set any key to a positive integer to change
it; omitted keys keep their default. Each limit counts only the prose GitHub
shows. Code blocks, tables, headings, quotes, link addresses, and the body of a
collapsed details block do not count. A collapsed block's summary label counts,
and an inline code span counts as one word.
In a description, only the part Shaka manages counts; text that people or other tools
add outside it is left alone.

- No sentence may run past `max_sentence_words`.
- No paragraph or list item may run past `max_paragraph_words`.
- The whole text may use 150 words plus `words_per_changed_line` for each
  changed line. A 6-line fix allows 174 words; a 100-line change allows 550.
- The description also stops at `max_description_words`, however large the change.

When text breaks a limit, nothing reaches GitHub. The command exits with an
error listing up to three problems and counting the rest. Each problem quotes a long
sentence or paragraph, or states the total word count and its limit. The agent rewrites the text
and runs the command again, so you see only a version that passed. The agent
notes each refusal in the description's collapsed review history, so you can
tell how often the limits fire.

For example, a 19-line change with a 950-word walkthrough is refused. The agent
splits long paragraphs, moves supporting detail into collapsed details, and
links to the code, then publishes again. Shaka reads these values from the
trusted default-branch revision when the agent passes `--ref`; without it, the
defaults apply. If that revision cannot be read, `description` still publishes
under the defaults and its result says why, while `walkthrough` stops.

## Standard command scripts

Connect your existing tools at these fixed paths:

| Script | Required? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.agents/shaka/bin/setup` | Yes | Install dependencies |
| `.agents/shaka/bin/test` | Yes | Run tests; accept focused arguments |
| `.agents/shaka/bin/validate` | Yes | Complete checks before publishing |
| `.agents/shaka/bin/validate-local` | No | Faster checks before local review |
| `.agents/shaka/bin/trigger-hosted-ci` | No | Start deferred CI after local fixes; requires `validate-local` |

In the older layout, the same scripts live in `.agents/bin/`.

A wrapper can call an existing command. `seam init` generates each required wrapper;
it finds the repository root with Git, so it works from any directory and in linked
worktrees. To run a different command, change only its last line, for example:

```sh
exec bundle exec rake test "$@"
```

`exec` preserves the command's exit status and signals. A symlink to a tracked
executable also works if its directory, environment, and arguments already match.

Scripts must be executable and resolve within the repository. `.agents` and the
directories holding the configuration and scripts must be real directories.
Removing an optional check already on the default branch requires an explicit,
maintainer-approved policy change.

## `base_branch`

**Optional. Default: the repository's default branch.**

Use `base_branch: develop` to start from and target `develop`. An explicit task
choice or existing PR target takes precedence. A base outside the configured or
default branch needs confirmation and uses Ask. Policy always comes from the
default branch.

## `branches.name`

**Optional. Default: `'{login}-{host}/{issue}-{description}'`.**

```yaml
branches:
  name: '{login}-{host}/{issue}-{description}'
```

| Placeholder | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `{login}` | Authenticated GitHub login |
| `{host}` | Coding-agent slug, such as `codex` or `claude` |
| `{issue}` | Issue, PR, or work-item number; required in the template |
| `{description}` | Short task description |

For example: `alex-codex/42-fix-search`.

When a task comes from a tracker that offers a branch name, such as Linear's
**Copy git branch name**, the agent uses that name instead of the template.
Trackers link a pull request to its
work item through that branch name. Git must accept the name as a branch name.

## `pr_description.show_shaka_credit`

**Optional. Default: `true`.**

PR descriptions show *PR prepared with [Shaka](https://shaka.shakacode.com/).* below
the opening summary. The credit helps readers discover the workflow that prepared
the PR and try it on their own project.

When Shaka is configured for a repository, the credit helps teammates discover its
workflow. For private repositories, leave attribution enabled while introducing
Shaka, then turn it off once the team is familiar with it.

To hide the credit, set:

```yaml
pr_description:
  show_shaka_credit: false
```

The setting applies to PR descriptions. Walkthroughs and replies do not carry this
credit. Hiding it keeps verification, execution provenance, and usage visible in
their existing sections. Shaka also omits the credit when repository settings
cannot be read.

## `wip.include_locations`

**Optional. Default: `true`.**

```yaml
wip:
  include_locations: true
```

Include the checkout path and session link in **WIP Details**. Both team setup and
private trials write `true`. The description renderer replaces both
location fields with `REDACTED` when the selected setting is false or unavailable;
ownership, state, next action, and the current commit remain visible.

Locations can reveal local names or identifiers. When locations are enabled,
the agent must inspect them before publishing. Other supplied prose still needs
inspection for private information. Expandable sections on public PRs are public too.

## `repo_prefix`

**Optional. Default: a label derived from the repository name.**

Use 1–6 uppercase ASCII letters or digits, such as `repo_prefix: SHOP`, to label
chat titles: `SHOP PR #42 · Fix checkout`. The
[repository catalog](repository-catalog.md) reports duplicate prefixes.

## `version`

**Required. Currently `1`.** This identifies the configuration format, not the
installed Shaka release.

Unknown keys and invalid values produce an error. Link requirements and design
plans from `AGENTS.md`.
