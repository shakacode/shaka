# Writing preferences

Tell the agent how you want it to write:

```text
Keep this PR description to three bullets. Explain what changed for the user
and put implementation details in the walkthrough.
```

To reuse preferences across tasks, add `.agents/writing-style.md` to your repository:

```markdown
# Writing style

- Write documentation for someone new to the project.
- Keep PR descriptions short and lead with what changed for the user.
- Use before-and-after examples when they clarify behavior.
```

Once the file is merged into your default branch, Shaka loads it automatically.
You can override these defaults in a task. Existing writing instructions in
`AGENTS.md` and your personal agent instructions also take precedence.

If Shaka reports a problem with the file, ask the agent to fix it. You can keep
working and give writing instructions in chat.
