# Writing preferences

Shaka's installed skill provides [default writing guidance](https://github.com/shakacode/shaka/blob/main/skills/shaka/references/writing.md)
for PR descriptions, code walkthroughs, and review replies. Installing Shaka does
not create or edit `AGENTS.md`, and these defaults work without that file.

For a task, tell the agent how you want it to write:

```text
Keep PR descriptions short. Lead with what changed for the user,
use before/after examples, and put implementation details in the walkthrough.
```

For persistent repository preferences, you may create or edit `AGENTS.md` yourself.
You may link to a separate file when the guidance is long or has a distinct
audience. For example:

```text
When writing this repository's product guides, read docs/editorial-style.md.
```

When trusted `AGENTS.md` exists, the Shaka workflow instructs the agent to follow
its writing preferences and any style file it explicitly links. Shaka's Ruby
helpers do not automatically load a linked file or verify editorial style.

Shaka also refuses to publish a description or walkthrough that reads as a wall
of text. It checks sentence length, paragraph length, and total length against
the size of the change, so the text points reviewers to the code. You can change
these limits with [`prose_limits`](settings.md#prose_limits).
