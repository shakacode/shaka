# Control towers

Control towers are optional tools for tracking work across repositories. Try Shaka
on a few tasks first.

A **Repository Control Tower (RCT)** follows one repository's priorities and tasks.
A **Master Control Tower (MCT)** coordinates RCTs and dependencies—for example, a
library fix needed before an application upgrade.

Ask your agent to install the tower skills and establish the master. Then open a
task in each repository and invoke its setup skill:

| Environment | Repository tower | Master tower |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex app | `$rct` | Agent follows the master role instructions |
| Claude Code desktop | `/rct-claude` | `/mct-claude` |

After the master acknowledges the repository tower, ask the tower what needs
attention. You choose which task starts; setup starts no backlog work or recurring
scans.

Keep each tower set in one environment: Claude and Codex cannot read each other's
sessions. See the [operating procedures](../skills/shaka/references/control-towers.md)
for setup, ownership, and handoff.
