# Releasing the Gem

Shaka uses a small, explicit RubyGems release flow adapted from
`shakacode/control-plane-flow`. A release starts from an approved version on `main`,
validates the packaged artifact, tags the exact source commit, publishes the gem, and
creates the matching GitHub release. Registry publication requires explicit maintainer
approval because a published version cannot be replaced.

## Release process

1. Change `Shaka::VERSION` in `skills/shaka/lib/shaka/version.rb` through a reviewed pull
   request and merge it. The gemspec reads that constant, and `shaka seam init` stamps it
   into the `.agents/README.md` it generates.
2. Start from a clean, current `main` checkout.
3. Install dependencies and run the repository validation:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   bin/validate
   ```

4. Build and inspect the gem before changing any remote state:

   ```bash
   gem build shaka.gemspec
   gem specification shaka-VERSION.gem
   ```

5. Prepare and review `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, then obtain explicit maintainer approval for
   the registry publication. Stop here until that approval is recorded.

6. Set the approved version and confirm it is absent from RubyGems, GitHub releases,
   and remote tags. The first command lists existing prereleases; the latter commands
   should report that the target does not exist:

   ```bash
   shaka_version=0.1.0.pre.2
   gem list shaka --remote --all --exact --prerelease
   gh release view "v$shaka_version"
   git ls-remote --exit-code --tags origin "refs/tags/v$shaka_version"
   ```

7. Tag and push the validated commit:

   ```bash
   git tag -a "v$shaka_version" -m "Release shaka $shaka_version"
   git push origin "refs/tags/v$shaka_version"
   ```

8. Publish with the maintainer's RubyGems credentials and MFA code:

   ```bash
   gem push "shaka-$shaka_version.gem"
   ```

9. Create the GitHub release from the verified tag and reviewed notes. Use
   `--prerelease` only for a prerelease version; omit it for a stable version:

   ```bash
   gh release create "v$shaka_version" --verify-tag --prerelease \
     --title "shaka $shaka_version" --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md
   ```

10. Verify RubyGems and GitHub, then install the exact version into a temporary
    `GEM_HOME` from the registry. Exercise `shaka --help`, then remove it:

    ```bash
    gem list shaka --remote --all --exact --prerelease
    gh release view "v$shaka_version"
    shaka_gem_home=$(mktemp -d)
    GEM_HOME="$shaka_gem_home" GEM_PATH="$shaka_gem_home" \
      gem install shaka --version "$shaka_version" --no-document
    GEM_HOME="$shaka_gem_home" GEM_PATH="$shaka_gem_home" \
      "$shaka_gem_home/bin/shaka" --help
    GEM_HOME="$shaka_gem_home" GEM_PATH="$shaka_gem_home" \
      gem uninstall shaka --all --executables
    ```

## Failure recovery

Before retrying, check RubyGems, the remote tag, and the GitHub release independently.
If the gem was published but the GitHub release failed, preserve the tag and create the
release. If the tag was pushed but RubyGems rejected the upload, diagnose credentials,
MFA, or package policy before retrying the same artifact. Never reuse or overwrite a
published version; prepare a new version through a pull request instead.
